# Syntax [Statement]

## Java VS Tests

## Goal

Your goal is to upgrade and improve your understanding of Java syntax through practice. To do that, you will also apply and understand object-oriented programming concepts in Java by creating and implementing functions and methods, manipulating objects, and creating program logic according to external requirements in the form of tests.

## Skills

By doing this assignment you will:

- Create classes and define methods with Java
- Get familiar with string manipulation and regular expressions
- Apply recursive and iterative algorithms to your solution in Java
- Learn how to use getters and setters to access and modify object properties
- Use constructors to initialise objects with default and custom values
- Declare methods and use return values to perform specific tasks in your program
- Utilize loops to iterate over arrays and manipulate array elements
- Understand the difference between primitive and reference Java types

## Instructions

Your task is to implement the `Ai` class. This class should not use the default constructor. `Ai` must have two properties, both Strings: `creationDate` and `name`. Your custom constructor should set values to those properties. The class also needs to have the necessary getters and setters for both instance variables.

Class `Ai` also has to include the following methods:

- `doubleArray` — takes an int array as an argument and returns a new array with all values doubled
- `factorialIterative` — takes an int as an argument and returns the factorial of that int using an iterative approach
- `factorialRecursive` — takes an int as an argument and returns the factorial of that int using a recursive approach
- `palindromeReplace` — takes a string as an argument and returns a new string with all the occurrences of words that are palindromes replaced with the word “palindrome”
- `emailValidator` — takes no arguments and returns a string with a regex expression to validate emails

When you’re finished, you should create a `Playground` class. This class should be able to demonstrate the functionality of the `Ai` class by instantiating one or more AI objects, invoking its methods, and displaying the results in the console.
